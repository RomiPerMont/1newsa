          The series, based on the acclaimed video game franchise developed by Naughty Dog, follows Joel and Ellie as they navigate a post-apocalyptic United States ravaged by a fungal infection. The show's narrative has closely followed the games, with season two adapting <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>.
